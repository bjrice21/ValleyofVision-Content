# Family Prayers Section Guidelines

This document provides guidance for AI agents and contributors when categorizing family prayers.

## Section Pattern

All family prayer sections follow the pattern: **"When I..."**

This reflects the personal, situational nature of these prayers - they're organized by the emotional or spiritual state of the person praying.

## Current Sections

The family channel uses the following sections to organize prayers:

### Core Existing Sections

#### 1. When I Need Help

#### 3. When I'm Thankful

## Guidelines for New Sections

If a prayer doesn't fit the 11 existing categories above, new sections can be created following these rules:

1. **Must start with "When I..."** to maintain consistency
2. Should reflect a common emotional, temporal, or spiritual state
3. Should be broadly applicable to multiple prayers
4. Should not overlap significantly with existing sections

Consider these potential new sections only if absolutely needed:
- "When I'm Afraid" - for prayers dealing with fear and anxiety (if not covered by "When I'm Struggling")
- "When I'm Joyful" - for celebration and rejoicing (if beyond "When I'm Thankful")
- "When I'm Confused" - for times of uncertainty (if different from "When I'm Searching")
- "When I Need Wisdom" - for decision-making and discernment (if not covered by existing sections)

## Choosing the Right Section

When categorizing a prayer, consider:

1. **Primary theme**: What is the main emotional or spiritual state?
2. **Prayer's purpose**: What is the person seeking or expressing?
3. **Opening lines**: Often indicate the prayer's focus
4. **Overall tone**: Desperate, grateful, contemplative, etc.
