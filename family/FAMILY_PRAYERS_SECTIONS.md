# Family Prayers Section Guidelines

This document provides guidance for AI agents and contributors when categorizing family prayers.

## Section Pattern

All family prayer sections follow the pattern: **"When I..."**

This reflects the personal, situational nature of these prayers - they're organized by the emotional or spiritual state of the person praying.

## Current Sections

Based on existing prayers in the family channel:

### 1. When I Need Help
For prayers seeking God's assistance, guidance, or intervention in difficult situations.

### 2. When I'm Struggling  
For prayers during times of hardship, temptation, or spiritual battles.

### 3. When I'm Thankful
For prayers of gratitude, praise, and appreciation for God's blessings.

### 4. When I Want to Grow
For prayers focused on spiritual development, maturity, and becoming more Christ-like.

### 5. When I'm Searching
For prayers of seeking God's will, looking for answers, or desiring deeper understanding.

## Guidelines for New Sections

If a prayer doesn't fit existing categories, new sections can be created following these rules:

1. **Must start with "When I..."** to maintain consistency
2. Should reflect a common emotional or spiritual state
3. Should be broadly applicable to multiple prayers
4. Consider these potential new sections only if needed:
   - "When I'm Afraid" - for prayers dealing with fear and anxiety
   - "When I'm Joyful" - for celebration and rejoicing (beyond thankfulness)
   - "When I'm Confused" - for times of uncertainty (different from searching)
   - "When I Need Wisdom" - for decision-making and discernment

## Choosing the Right Section

When categorizing a prayer, consider:

1. **Primary theme**: What is the main emotional or spiritual state?
2. **Prayer's purpose**: What is the person seeking or expressing?
3. **Opening lines**: Often indicate the prayer's focus
4. **Overall tone**: Desperate, grateful, contemplative, etc.

## Example Mappings

- Asking for strength → "When I Need Help"
- Dealing with sin/temptation → "When I'm Struggling"  
- Praising God's character → "When I'm Thankful"
- Wanting to be more like Christ → "When I Want to Grow"
- Seeking God's presence/will → "When I'm Searching"
