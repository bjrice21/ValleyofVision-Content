    "text": "O holy father, thou hast freely given thy Son,\nO divine son, thou hast freely paid my debt,\nO eternal spirit, thou dost freely bid me come,\nO triune god, thou dost freely grace me with salvation.\nPrayers and tears could not suffice to pardon my sins,\nnor anything less than atoning blood,\nbut my believing is my receiving,\nfor a thankful acceptance is no paying of the debt.\nWhat didst thou sec in me?\nthat I a poor, diseased, despised sinner\nshould be clothed in thy bright glory?\nthat a creeping worm\nshould be advanced to this high state?\nthat one lately groaning, weeping, dying,\nshould be as full of joy as my heart can hold?\nthat a being of dust and darkness\nshould be taken like Mordecai from captivity,\nand set next to the king?\nshould be lifted like Daniel from a den\nand be made ruler of princes and provinces?\nWho can fathom immeasurable love?\nAs far as the rational soul exceeds the senses,\nso does the spirit exceed the rational in its knowledge of thee.\nThou hast given me understanding to compass the earth,\nmeasure the sun, moon, stars, universe,\nbut above all to know thee, the only true God.\nI marvel that the finite can know the Infinite,\nhere a little, afterwards in full-orbed truth;\nNow I know but a small portion of what I shall know,\nhere in part, there in perfection,\nhere a glimpse, there a glory.\nTo enjoy thee is life eternal, and to enjoy is to know.\nKeep me in the freedom of experiencing thy salvation continually.",
