    "text": "O LORD OF THE OCEANS,\nMy little bark sails on a restless sea,\nGrant that Jesus may sit at the helm and steer me safely;\nSuffer no adverse currents to divert my heavenward course;\nLet not my faith be wrecked amid storms and shoals;\nBring me to harbour with flying pennants,\nhull unbreached, cargo unspoiled.\nI ask great things,\nexpect great things,\nshall receive great things.\nI venture on thee wholly, fully,\nmy wind, sunshine, anchor, defence.\nThe voyage is long, the waves high, the storms pitiless,\nbut my helm is held steady,\nthy Word secures safe passage,\nthy grace wafts me onward,\nmy haven is guaranteed.\nThis day will bring me nearer home,\nGrant me holy consistency in every transaction,\nmy peace flowing as a running tide,\nmy righteousness as every chasing wave.\nHelp me to live circumspectly,\nwith skill to convert every care into prayer,\nHalo my path with gentleness and love,\nsmooth every asperity of temper;\nlet me not forget how easy it is to occasion grief;\nmay I strive to bind up every wound,\nand pour oil on all troubled waters.\nMay the world this day be happier and better because I live.\nLet my mast before me be the saviour's cross,\nand every oncoming wave the fountain in his side.\nHelp me, protect me in the moving sea\nuntil I reach the shore of unceasing praise.",
