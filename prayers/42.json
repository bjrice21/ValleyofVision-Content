  "content": "Thou art beforehand with men\nfor thou hast reconciled thyself to the world through the cross,\nand dost beseech men to accept reconciliation.\nIt is my responsibility to grasp thy overtures of grace,\nfor if thou, the offended party, act first\nwith the word of appeasement,\nI need not call in question thy willingness to save,\nbut must deplore my own foolish maliciousness;\nIf I do not come to thee as one who seeks thy favour,\nI live in contempt, anger, malice, self-sufficiency,\nand thou dost call it enmity.\nThou hast taught me the necessity of a mediator, a messiah,\nto be embraced in love with all my heart,\nas king to rule me,\nas prophet to guide me,\nas priest to take away my sin and death,\nand this by faith in thy beloved Son who teaches me\nnot to guide myself,\nnot to obey myself,\nnot to try to rule and conquer sin,\nbut to cleave to the one who will do all for me.\nThou hast made known to me\nthat to save me is Christ's work,\nbut to cleave to him by faith is my work,\nand with this faith is the necessity of my daily repentance\nas a mourning for the sin which Christ by grace has removed.\nContinue, O God, to teach me\nthat faith apprehends Christ's righteousness\nnot only for the satisfaction of justice,\nbut as unspotted evidence of thy love to me.\nHelp me to make use of his work of salvation as the ground of peace,\nand of thy favour to, and acceptance of me the sinner,\nso that I may live always near the cross."
