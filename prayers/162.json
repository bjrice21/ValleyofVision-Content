  "content": "I bless thee that the issue of the battle between thyself and Satan\nhas never been uncertain,\nand will end in victory.\nCalvary broke the dragon's head,\nand I contend with a vanquished foe,\nwho with all his subtlety and strength\nhas already been overcome.\nWhen I feel the serpent at my heel\nmay I remember him whose heel was bruised,\nbut who, when bruised, broke the devil's head.\nMy soul with inward joy extols the mighty conqueror.\nHeal me of any wounds received in the great conflict;\nif I have gathered defilement,\nif my faith has suffered damage,\nif my hope is less than bright,\nif my love is not fervent,\nif some creature-comfort occupies my heart,\nif my soul sinks under pressure of the fight.\nO thou whose every promise is balm,\nevery touch life,\ndraw near to thy weary warrior,\nrefresh me, that I may rise again to wage the strife,\nand never are until my enemy is trodden down.\nGive me such fellowship with thee that I may defy Satan,\nunbelief, the flesh, the world,\nwith delight that comes not from a creature,\nand which a creature cannot mar.\nGive me a draught of the eternal fountain\nthat lieth in thy immutable, everlasting love and decree.\nThen shall my hand never weaken, my feet never stumble,\nmy sword never rest, my shield never rust,\nmy helmet never shatter, my breastplate never fall,\nas my strength rests in the power of thy might."
