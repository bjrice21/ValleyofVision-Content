  "content": "THOU GREAT AND ONLY POTENTATE,\nThou hast made summer and winter, day and night;\neach of these revolutions serves our welfare\nand is full of thy care and kindness.\nThy bounty is seen\nin the relations that train us,\nthe laws that defend us,\nthe homes that shelter us,\nthe food that builds us,\nthe raiment that comforts us,\nthe continuance of our health, members, senses,\nunderstanding, memory, affection, will.\nBut as stars fade before the rising sun,\nthou hast eclipsed all these benefits\nin the wisdom and grace that purposed\nredemption by Jesus thy Son.\nBlessed be thy mercy that laid help on\none that is mighty and willing,\none that is able to save to the uttermost.\nMake us deeply sensible\nof our need of his saving grace,\nof the blood that cleanses,\nof the rest he has promised,\nAnd impute to us that righteousness which justifies the guilty,\ngives them a tide to eternal life,\nand possession of the Spirit,\nMay we love the freeness of salvation, and joy in its holiness;\nGive us faith to grasp thy promises, that are our hope,\nprovide for every exigency, and prevent every evil;\nKeep our hearts from straying after forbidden pleasures;\nMay thy will bind all our wishes;\nLet us five out of the world as to its spirit, maxim, manners,\nbut live in it as the sphere of our action and usefulness;\nMay we be alive to every call of duty, accepting without question\nthy determination of our circumstances and our service."
