  "content": "O GOD OF THE OPEN BAR,\nTeach me to live by prayer as well as by providence,\nfor myself, soul, body, children, family, church;\nGive me a heart frameable to thy will;\nso might I live in prayer, and honour thee,\nbeing kept from evil, known and unknown.\nHelp me to see the sin that accompanies all I do,\nand the good I can distil from everything.\nLet me know that the work of prayer is to bring my will to thine,\nand that without this it is folly to pray;\nWhen I try to bring thy will to mine it is to command Christ,\nto be above him, and wiser than he:\nthis is my sin and pride.\nI can only succeed when I pray\naccording to thy precept and promise,\nand to be done with as it pleases thee,\naccording to thy sovereign will.\nWhen thou commandest me to pray for pardon, peace, brokenness,\nit is because thou wilt give me the thing promised,\nfor thy glory, as well as for my good.\nHelp me not only to desire small things\nbut with holy boldness to desire great things for thy people,\nfor myself, that they and I might live to show thy glory.\nTeach me that it is wisdom for me to pray for all I have,\nout of love, willingly, not of necessity;\nthat I may come to thee at any time,\nto lay open my needs acceptably to thee;\nthat my great sin lies in my not keeping the savour of thy\nways;\nthat the remembrance of this truth is one way\nto the sense of thy presence;\nthat there is no wrath like the wrath of being governed\nby my own lusts for my own ends."
