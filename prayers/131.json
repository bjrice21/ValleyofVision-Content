  "content": "BENIGN LORD,\nI praise thee continually\nfor permission to approach thy throne of grace,\nand to spread my wants and desires before thee.\nI am not worthy of thy blessings and mercies\nfor I am far gone from original righteousness;\nMy depraved nature reveals itself in disobedience and rebellion;\nMy early days discovered in me discontent, pride, envy, revenge.\nRemember not the sins of my youth,\nnor the multiplied transgressions of later years,\nmy failure to improve time and talents,\nmy abuse of mercies and means,\nmy wasted sabbaths, my perverted seasons of grace,\nmy long neglect of thy great salvation,\nmy disregard of the friend of sinners.\nWhile I confess my guilt, help me to feel it deeply,\nwith self-abhorrence and self-despair, yet\nto remember there is hope in thee,\nand to see the Lamb that takes away sin.\nThrough him may I return to thee,\nlisten to thee,\ntrust in thee,\ndelight in thy law,\nobey thee,\nbe upheld by thee.\nPreserve my understanding from error,\nmy affections from love of idols,\nmy lips from speaking guile,\nmy conduct from stain of vice,\nmy character from appearance of evil,\nthat I may be harmless, blameless, rebukeless,\nexemplary, useful, light-giving, prudent, zealous for\nthy glory and the good of my fellow-men."
