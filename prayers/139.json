  "content": "REMEMBER, O MY SOUL,\nIt is thy duty and privilege to rejoice in God:\nHe requires it of thee for all his favours of grace.\nRejoice then in the giver and his goodness,\nBe happy in him, O my heart, and in nothing but God,\nfor whatever a man trusts in,\nfrom that he expects happiness.\nHe who is the ground of thy faith\nshould be the substance of thy joy.\nWhence then come heaviness and dejection,\nwhen joy is sown in thee,\npromised by the Father,\nbestowed by the Son,\ninwrought by the Holy Spirit,\nthine by grace,\nthy birthright in believing?\nArt thou seeking to rejoice in thyself\nfrom an evil motive of pride and self-reputation?\nThou hast nothing of thine own but sin,\nnothing to move God to be gracious,\nor to continue his grace towards thee.\nIf thou forget this thou wilt lose thy joy.\nArt thou grieving under a sense of indwelling sin?\nLet godly sorrow work repentance,\nas the true spirit which the Lord blesses,\nand which creates fullest joy;\nSorrow for self opens rejoicing in God,\nSelf-loathing draws down divine delights.\nHast thou sought joys in some creature comfort?\nLook not below God for happiness;\nfall not asleep in Delilah's lap.\nLet God be all in all to thee,\nand joy in the fountain that is always full."
