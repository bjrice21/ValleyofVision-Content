  "content": "If I love thee my soul shall seek thee,\nbut can I seek thee unless my love to thee is kept\nalive to this end?\nDo I love thee because thou art good,\nand canst alone do me good?\nIt is fitting thou shouldest not regard me,\nfor I am vile and selfish;\nyet I seek thee,\nand when I find thee there is no wrath to devour me,\nbut only sweet love.\nThou dost stand as a rock between the scorching sun and my soul,\nand I live under the cool lee-side as one elect.\nWhen my mind acts without thee\nit spins nothing but deceit and delusion;\nWhen my affections act without thee\nnothing is seen but dead works.\nO how I need thee to abide in me,\nfor I have no natural eyes to see thee,\nbut I live by faith in one whose face to me\nis brighter than a thousand suns!\nWhen I see that all sin is in me,\nall shame belongs to me;\nlet me know that all good is in thee, all glory is thine.\nKeep me from the error of thinking thou dost appear gloriously\nwhen some strange light fills my heart,\nas if that were the glorious activity of grace,\nbut let me see that the truest revelation of thyself\nis when thou dost eclipse all my personal glory\nand all the honour, pleasure, and good of this world.\nThe Son breaks out in glory\nwhen he shows himself as one who outshines all creation,\nmakes men poor in spirit,\nand helps them to find their good in him.\nGrant that I may distrust myself, to see my all in thee."
