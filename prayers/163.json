  "content": "Forgive me for serving thee in sinful ways -\nby glorying in my own strength,\nby forcing myself to minister through necessity,\nby accepting the applause of others,\nby trusting in assumed grace and spiritual affection,\nby a faith that rests upon my hold on Christ, not on him\nalone.\nby having another foundation to stand upon beside thee;\nfor thus I make flesh my arm.\nHelp me to see\nthat it is faith stirred by grace that does the deed,\nthat faith brings a man nearer to thee,\nraising him above mere man,\nthat thou dost act upon the soul when thus elevated\nand lifted out of itself,\nthat faith centres in thee as God all-sufficient,\nFather, Son, Holy Spirit,\nas God efficient,\nmediately, as in thy commands and promises,\nimmediately, in all the hidden power\nthat faith sees and knows to be in thee,\nabundantly, with omnipotent effect,\nin the revelation of thy will\nIf I have not such faith I am nothing.\nIt is my duty to set thee above all others in mind and eye;\nBut it is my sin that I place myself above thee.\nLord, it is the special evil of sin\nthat every breach of thy law arises\nfrom contempt of thy person,\nfrom despising thee and thy glory,\nfrom preferring things before thee.\nHelp me to abhor myself in comparison of thee,\nAnd keep me in a faith that works by love, and serves by grace."
