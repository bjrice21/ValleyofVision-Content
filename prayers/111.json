  "content": "As I cross the threshold of this day\nI commit myself, soul, body, affairs, friends, to thy care;\nWatch over, keep, guide, direct, sanctify, bless me.\nIncline my heart to thy ways;\nMould me wholly into the image of Jesus, as a potter forms clay;\nMay my lips be a well-tuned harp to sound thy praise;\nLet those around see me living by thy Spirit,\ntrampling the world underfoot,\nunconformed to lying vanities,\ntransformed by a renewed mind,\nclad in the entire armour of God,\nshining as a never-dimmed light,\nshowing holiness in all my doings.\nLet no evil this day soil my thoughts, words, hands.\nMay I travel miry paths with a life pure from spot or stain.\nIn needful transactions let my affection be in heaven,\nand my love soar upwards in names of fire,\nmy gaze fixed on unseen things,\nmy eyes open to the emptiness, fragility,\nmockery of earth and its vanities.\nMay I view all things in the mirror of eternity,\nwaiting for the coming of my Lord,\nlistening for the last trumpet call,\nhastening unto the new heaven and earth.\nOrder this day all my communications according to thy wisdom,\nand to the gain of mutual good.\nForbid that I should not be profited or made profitable.\nMay I speak each word as if my last word,\nand walk each step as my final one.\nIf my life should end today, let this be my best day."
