  "content": "o source of all good,\nWhat shall I render to thee for the gift of gifts,\nthine own dear Son, begotten, not created,\nmy redeemer, proxy, surety, substitute,\nhis self-emptying incomprehensible,\nhis infinity of love beyond the heart's grasp.\nHerein is wonder of wonders:\nhe came below to raise me above,\nwas born like me that I might become like him.\nHerein is love;\nwhen I cannot rise to him he draws near on wings of grace,\nto raise me to himself.\nHerein is power;\nwhen Deity and humanity were infinitely apart\nhe united them in indissoluble unity, the uncreate and the created.\nHerein is wisdom;\nwhen I was undone, with no will to return to him,\nand no intellect to devise recovery,\nhe came, God-incarnate, to save me to the uttermost,\nas man to die my death,\nto shed satisfying blood on my behalf,\nto work out a perfect righteousness for me.\nO God, take me in spirit to the watchful shepherds, and\nenlarge my mind;\nlet me hear good tidings of great joy,\nand hearing, believe, rejoice, praise, adore,\nmy conscience bathed in an ocean of repose,\nmy eyes uplifted to a reconciled Father;\nplace me with ox, ass, camel, goat,\nto look with them upon my redeemer's face,\nand in him account myself delivered from sin;\nlet me with Simeon clasp the new-born child to my heart,\nembrace him with undying faith,\nexulting that he is mine and I am his.\nIn him thou hast given me so much that heaven can give no more."
