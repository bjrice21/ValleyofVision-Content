  "content": "Enlarge my heart, warm my affections, open my lips,\nsupply words that proclaim 'Love lustres at Calvary.'\nThere grace removes my burdens and heaps them on thy Son,\nmade a transgressor, a curse, and sin for me;\nThere the sword of thy justice smote the man, thy fellow;\nThere thy infinite attributes were magnified,\nand infinite atonement was made;\nThere infinite punishment was due,\nand infinite punishment was endured.\nChrist was all anguish that I might be all joy,\ncast off that I might be brought in,\ntrodden down as an enemy\nthat I might be welcomed as a friend,\nsurrendered to hell's wont\nthat I might attain heaven's best,\nstripped that I might be clothed,\nwounded that I might be healed,\nathirst that I might drink,\ntormented that I might be comforted,\nmade a shame that I might inherit glory,\nentered darkness that I might have eternal light,\nMy Saviour wept that all tears might be wiped from my eyes,\ngroaned that I might have endless song,\nendured all pain that I might have unfading health,\nbore a thorned crown that I might have a glory-diadem,\nbowed his head that I might uplift mine,\nexperienced reproach that I might receive welcome,\nclosed his eyes in death that I might gaze on unclouded\nbrightness,\nexpired that I might for ever live.\nO Father, who spared not thine only Son that thou mightest spare me,\nAll this transfer thy love designed and accomplished;\nHelp me to adore thee by lips and life.\nO that my every breath might be ecstatic praise,\nmy every step buoyant with delight, as I see"
