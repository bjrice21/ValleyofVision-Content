  "content": "MY MASTER GOD,\nI am desired to preach today,\nbut go weak and needy to my task;\nYet I long that people might be edified with divine truth,\nthat an honest testimony might be borne for thee;\nGive me assistance in preaching and prayer,\nwith heart uplifted for grace and unction.\nPresent to my view things pertinent to my subject,\nwith fullness of matter and clarity of thought,\nproper expressions, fluency, fervency,\na feeling sense of the things I preach,\nand grace to apply them to men's consciences.\nKeep me conscious all the while of my defects,\nand let me not gloat in pride over my performance.\nHelp me to offer a testimony for thyself,\nand to leave sinners inexcusable in neglecting thy mercy.\nGive me freedom to open the sorrows of thy people,\nand to set before them comforting considerations.\nAttend with power the truth preached,\nand awaken the attention of my slothful audience.\nMay thy people be refreshed, melted, convicted, comforted,\nand help me to use the strongest arguments\ndrawn from Christ's incarnation and sufferings,\nthat men might be made holy.\nI myself need thy support, comfort, strength, holiness,\nthat I might be a pure channel of thy grace,\nand be able to do something for thee;\nGive me then refreshment among thy people,\nand help me not to treat excellent matter in a defective way,\nor bear a broken testimony to so worthy a redeemer,\nor be harsh in treating of Christ's death, its design and end,\nfrom lack of warmth and fervency.\nAnd keep me in tune with thee as I do this work."
