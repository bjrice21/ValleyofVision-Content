  "content": "O god of the highest heaven,\noccupy the throne of my heart,\ntake full possession and reign supreme,\nlay low every rebel lust, let no vile passion resist thy holy war;\nmanifest thy mighty power,\nand make me thine for ever.\nThou art worthy to be praised with my every breath,\nloved with my every faculty of soul,\nserved with my every act of life.\nThou hast loved me, espoused me, received me,\npurchased, washed, favoured, clothed, adorned me,\nwhen I was worthless, vile, soiled, polluted.\nI was dead in iniquities,\nhaving no eyes to see thee,\nno ears to hear thee,\nno taste to relish thy joys,\nno intelligence to know thee;\nBut thy Spirit has quickened me,\nhas brought me into a new world as a new creature,\nhas given me spiritual perception,\nhas opened to me thy Word as light, guide, solace,\nThy presence is to me a treasure of unending peace;\nNo provocation can part me from thy sympathy,\nfor thou hast drawn me with cords of love,\nand dost forgive me daily, hourly.\nO help me then to walk worthy of thy love,\nof my hopes, and my vocation.\nKeep me, for I cannot keep myself;\nProtect me that no evil befall me;\nLet me lay aside every sin admired of many;\nHelp me to walk by thy side, lean on thy arm,\nhold converse with thee,\nThat henceforth I may be salt of the earth and a blessing to all."
