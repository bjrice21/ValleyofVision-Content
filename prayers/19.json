  "content": "o father.\nThou hast made man for the glory of thyself,\nand when not an instrument of that glory,\nhe is a thing of nought;\nNo sin is greater than the sin of unbelief,\nfor if union with Christ is the greatest good,\nunbelief is the greatest sin,\nas being cross to thy command;\nI see that whatever my sin is,\nyet no sin is like disunion from Christ by unbelief.\nLord, keep me from committing the greatest sin in departing from him,\nfor I can never in this life perfectly obey and cleave to Christ.\nWhen thou takest away my outward blessings, it is for sin,\nin not acknowledging that all that I have is of thee,\nin not serving thee through what I have,\nin making myself secure and hardened.\nLawful blessings are the secret idols, and do most hurt;\nthe greatest injury is in the having,\nthe greatest good in the taking away.\nIn love divest me of blessings that I may glorify thee the more;\nremove the fuel of my sin,\nand may I prize the gain of a little holiness\nas overbalancing all my losses.\nThe more I love thee with a truly gracious love\nthe more I desire to love thee,\nand the more miserable I am at my want of love;\nThe more I hunger and thirst after thee,\nthe more I faint and fail in finding thee,\nThe more my heart is broken for sin,\nthe more I pray it may be far more broken.\nMy great evil is that I do not remember the sins of my youth,\nnay, the sins of one day I forget the next.\nKeep me from all things that turn to unbelief\nor lack of felt union with Christ."
