  "content": "I have sinned times without number,\nand been guilty of pride and unbelief,\nof failure to find thy mind in thy Word,\nof neglect to seek thee in my daily life.\nMy transgressions and short-comings\npresent me with a list of accusations,\nBut I bless thee that they will not stand against me,\nfor all have been laid on Christ;\nGo on to subdue my corruptions,\nand grant me grace to live above them.\nLet not the passions of the flesh nor lustings of the mind\nbring my spirit into subjection,\nbut do thou rule over me in liberty and power.\nI thank thee that many of my prayers have been refused--\nI have asked amiss and do not have,\nI have prayed from lusts and been rejected,\nI have longed for Egypt and been given a wilderness.\nGo on with thy patient work,\nanswering 'no' to my wrongful prayers, and fitting me to\naccept it.\nPurge me from every false desire, every base aspiration,\neverything contrary to thy rule.\nI thank thee for thy wisdom and thy love,\nfor all the acts of discipline to which I am subject,\nfor sometimes putting me into the furnace\nto refine my gold and remove my dross.\nNo trial is so hard to bear as a sense of sin.\nIf thou shouldst give me choice to live in pleasure and keep my sins,\nor to have them burnt away with trial,\ngive me sanctified affliction.\nDeliver me from every evil habit, every accretion of former sins,\neverything that dims the brightness of thy grace in me,\neverything that prevents me taking delight in thee.\nThen I shall bless thee, God of Jeshurun, for helping me to be upright,"
