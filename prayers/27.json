  "content": "O holy spirit,\nAs the sun is full of light, the ocean full of water,\nHeaven full of glory, so may my heart be full of thee.\nVain are all divine purposes of love\nand the redemption wrought by Jesus\nexcept thou work within,\nregenerating by thy power, giving me eyes to see Jesus,\nshowing me the realities of the unseen world.\nGive me thyself without measure,\nas an unimpaired fountain,\nas inexhaustible riches.\nI bewail my coldness, poverty, emptiness,\nimperfect vision, languid service,\nprayerless prayers, praiseless praises.\nSuffer me not to grieve or resist thee.\nCome as power,\nto expel every rebel lust, to reign supreme and keep me thine;\nCome as teacher,\nleading me into all truth, filling me with all understanding;\nCome as love,\nthat I may adore the Father, and love him as my all;\nCome as joy,\nto dwell in me, move in me, animate me;\nCome as light,\nilluminating the Scripture, moulding me in its laws;\nCome as sanctifier,\nbody, soul and spirit wholly thine;\nCome as helper,\nwith strength to bless and keep, directing my every step;\nCome as beautifxer,\nbringing order out of confusion, loveliness out of chaos.\nMagnify to me thy glory by being magnified in me,\nand make me redolent of thy fragrance."
