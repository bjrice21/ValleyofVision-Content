If I backslide,\nlet me like Peter weep bitterly and return to him;\nIf I am tempted, and have no wit,\ngive me strength enough to trust in him;\nIf I am weak,\nmay I faint upon his bosom of eternal love;\nIf in extremity,\nlet me feel that he can deliver me;\nIf driven to the verge of hope and to the pit of despair,\ngrant me grace to fall into his arms.\nO God, hear me, do for me more than I ask, think, or dream.",
