  "content": "BLESSED GOD,\nTen thousand snares are mine without and within,\ndefend thou me;\nWhen sloth and indolence seize me,\ngive me views of heaven;\nWhen sinners entice me,\ngive me disrelish of their ways;\nWhen sensual pleasures tempt me,\npurify and refute me;\nWhen I desire worldly possessions,\nhelp me to be rich toward thee;\nWhen the vanities of the world ensnare me,\nlet me not plunge into new guilt and ruin.\nMay I remember the dignity of my spiritual release,\nnever be too busy to attend to my soul,\nnever be so engrossed with time\nthat I neglect the things of eternity;\nthus may I not only live, but grow towards thee.\nForm my mind to right notions of religion,\nthat I may not judge of grace by wrong conceptions,\nnor measure my spiritual advances\nby the efforts of my natural being.\nMay I seek after an increase of divine love to thee,\nafter unreserved resignation to thy will,\nafter extensive benevolence to my fellow\ncreatures,\nafter patience and fortitude of soul,\nafter a heavenly disposition\nafter a concern that I may please thee in public\nand private.\nDraw on my soul the lineaments of Christ,\nin every trace and feature of which thou wilt take\ndelight, for I am thy workmanship,\ncreated in Christ Jesus,\nthy letter written with the Holy Spirit's pen,\nthy tilled soil ready for the sowing, then harvest."
