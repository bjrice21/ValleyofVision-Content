  "content": "The universe with all its myriad creatures is thine,\nmade by thy word, upheld by thy power, governed by thy will\nBut thou art also the Father of mercies,\nthe God of all grace,\nthe bestower of all comfort,\nthe protector of the saved.\nThou hast been mindful of us,\nhast visited us, preserved us,\ngiven us a goodly heritage--\nthe Holy Scriptures, the joyful gospel,\nthe saviour of souls,\nWe come to thee in Jesus' name,\nmake mention of his righteousness only,\nplead his obedience and sufferings\nwho magnified the law both in its precepts and penalty,\nand made it honourable.\nMay we be justified by his blood,\nsaved by his life,\njoined to his Spirit\nLet us take up his cross and follow him.\nMay the agency of thy grace prepare us for thy dispensations.\nMake us willing that thou shouldest choose our inheritance and\ndetermine what we shall retain or lose, suffer or enjoy;\nIf blessed with prosperity may we be free from its snares,\nand use, not abuse, its advantages;\nMay we patiently and cheerfully submit to those afflictions\nwhich are necessary.\nWhen we are tempted to wander, hedge up our way,\nexcite in us abhorrence of sin,\nwean us from the present evil world,\nAssure us that we shall at last enter Immanuel's land\nwhere none is ever sick, and the sun will always shine."
