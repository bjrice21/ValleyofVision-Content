  "content": "In a world of created changeable things,\nChrist and his Word alone remain unshaken.\nO to forsake all creatures,\nto rest as a stone on him the foundation,\nto abide in him, be borne up by him!\nFor all my mercies come through Christ,\nwho has designed, purchased, promised, effected them.\nHow sweet it is to be near him, the Lamb,\nfilled with holy affections!\nWhen I sin against thee I cross thy will, love, life,\nand have no comforter, no creature, to go to.\nMy sin is not so much this or that particular evil,\nbut my continual separation, disunion, distance from thee,\nand having a loose spirit towards thee.\nBut thou hast given me a present, Jesus thy Son,\nas mediator between thyself and my soul,\nas middle-man who in a pit\nholds both him below and him above,\nfor only he can span the chasm breached by sin,\nand satisfy divine justice.\nMay I always lay hold upon this mediator,\nas a realized object of faith,\nand alone worthy by his love to bridge the gulf.\nLet me know that he is dear to me by his Word;\nI am one with him by the Word on his part,\nand by faith on mine;\nIf I oppose the Word I oppose my Lord when he is most near;\nIf I receive the Word I receive my Lord wherein he is nigh.\nO thou who hast the hearts of all men in thine hand,\nform my heart according to the Word,\naccording to the image of thy Son,\nSo shall Christ the Word, and his Word, be my strength and comfort."
