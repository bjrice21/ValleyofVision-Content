    "text": "GREAT GOD,\nIn public and private, in sanctuary and home,\nmay my life be steeped in prayer,\nfilled with the spirit of grace and supplication,\neach prayer perfumed with the incense of atoning blood.\nHelp me, defend me, until from praying ground\nI pass to the realm of unceasing praise.\nUrged by my need,\nInvited by thy promises,\nCalled by thy Spirit,\nI enter thy presence, worshipping thee with godly fear, (\nawed by thy majesty, greatness, glory,\nbut encouraged by thy love. (\nI am all poverty as well as all guilt,\nhaving nothing of my own with which to repay thee,\nBut I bring Jesus to thee in the arms of faith,\npleading his righteousness to offset my iniquities,\nrejoicing that he will weigh down the scales for me,\nand satisfy thy justice.\nI bless thee that great sin draws out great grace,\nthat, although the lest sin deserves infinite punishment\nbecause done against an infinite God,\nyet there is mercy for me, for where guilt is most terrible,\nthere thy mercy in Christ is most free and deep.\nBless me by revealing to me more of his saving merits,\nby causing thy goodness to pass before me,\nby speaking peace to my contrite heart;\nStrengthen me to give thee no rest\nuntil Christ shall reign supreme within me,\nin every thought, word, and deed,\nin a faith that purifies the heart,\novercomes the world, works by love,\nfastens me to thee, and ever clings to\nthe cross.",
