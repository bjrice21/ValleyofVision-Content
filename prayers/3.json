    "text": "O god whose will conquers all,\nThere is no comfort in anything\napart from enjoying thee\nand being engaged in thy service;\nThou art All in all, and all enjoyments are what to me\nthou makest them, and no more.\nI am well pleased with thy will, whatever it is,\nor should be in all respects,\nAnd if thou bidst me decide for myself in any affair\nI would choose to refer all to thee.\nfor thou art infinitely wise and cannot do amiss,\nas I am in danger of doing.\nI rejoice to think that all things are at thy disposal,\nand it delights mc to leave them there.\nThen prayer turns wholly into praise, L\nand all I can do is to adore and bless thee.\nWhat shall I give thee for all thy benefits?\nI am in a strait betwixt two, knowing not what to do;\nI long to make some return, but have nothing to offer,\nand can only rejoice that thou doest all,\nthat none in heaven or on earth shares thy honour;\nI can of myself do nothing to glorify thy blessed name,\nbut I can through grace cheerfully surrender soul and body to thee,\nI know that thou art the author and finisher of faith,\nthat the whole work of redemption is thine alone,\nthat every good work or thought found in me\nis the effect of thy power and grace,\nthat thy sole motive in working in me to will and to do\nis for thy good pleasure.\nO God, it is amazing that men can talk so much\nabout man's creaturely power and goodness,\nwhen, if thou didst not hold us back every moment,\nwe should be devils incarnate.\nThis, by bitter experience, thou hast taught me concerning myself.",
