  "content": "O son of god and son of man,\nThou wast incarnate, didst suffer, rise, ascend for my sake;\nThy departure was not a token of separation but a pledge of return;\nThy Word, promises, sacraments, show thy death until thou come\nagain.\nThat day is no horror to me,\nfor thy death has redeemed me,\nthy Spirit fills me, thy love animates me,\nthy Word governs me.\nI have trusted thee and thou hast not betrayed my trust;\nwaited for thee, and not waited in vain.\nThou wilt come to raise my body from the dust, and re-unite it to\nmy soul,\nby a wonderful work of infinite power and love,\ngreater than that which bounds the oceans' waters,\nebbs and flows the tides,\nkeeps the stars in their courses,\nand gives life to all creatures.\nThis corruptible shall put on incorruption,\nthis mortal, immortality,\nthis natural body, a spiritual body,\nthis dishonoured body, a glorious body,\nthis weak body, a body of power.\nI triumph now in thy promises as I shall do in their performance,\nfor the head cannot live if the members are dead;\nBeyond the grave is resurrection, judgment, acquittal, dominion.\nEvery event and circumstance of my life will be dealt with--\nthe sins of my youth, my secret sins,\nthe sins of abusing thee, of disobeying thy Word,\nthe sins of neglecting ministers' admonitions,\nthe sins of violating my conscience--\nall will be judged;\nAnd after judgment, peace and rest, life and service,\nemployment and enjoyment, for thine elect.\nO God, keep me in this faith, and ever looking for Christ's return."
