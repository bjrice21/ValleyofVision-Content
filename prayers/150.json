  "content": "Thou hast revealed to me myself as a mass of sin,\nand thyself as the fullness of goodness,\nwith strength enough to succour me,\nwisdom enough to guide me,\nmercy enough to quicken me,\nlove enough to satisfy me.\nThou hast shown me that because thou art mine\nI can live by thy life,\nbe strong in thy strength,\nbe guided by thy wisdom;\nand so I can pitch my thoughts and heart in thee.\nThis is the exchange of wonderful love--\nfor me to have thee for myself, and for thee to have me,\nand to give me thyself.\nThere is in thee all fullness of the good I need,\nand the fullness of all grace to draw me to thyself,\nwho else could never have come.\nBut having come, I must cleave to thee,\nbe knit to thee, always seek thee.\nThere is none all good as thou art:\nWith thee I can live without other things,\nfor thou art God all-sufficient,\nand the glory, peace, rest, joy of the world\nis a creaturely, perishing thing in comparison with thee.\nHelp me to know that he who hopes for nothing but thee,\nand for all things only for thee, hopes truly,\nand that I must place all my happiness in holiness,\nif I hope to be filled with all grace.\nConvince me that I can have no peace at death,\nnor hope that I should go to Christ,\nunless I intend to do his will and have his fullness while I live."
