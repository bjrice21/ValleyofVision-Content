  "content": "O LORD,\nMay I\nnever fail to come to the knowledge of the truth,\nnever rest in a system of doctrine, however scriptural,\nthat does not bring or further salvation,\nor teach me to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,\nor help me to live soberly, righteously, godly;\nnever rely on my own convictions and resolutions,\nbut be strong in thee and in thy might;\nnever cease to find thy grace sufficient\nin all my duties, trials, and conflicts;\nnever forget to repair to thee\nin all my spiritual distresses and outward troubles,\nin all the dissatisfactions experienced in creature comforts;\nnever fail to retreat to him who is full of grace and truth,\nthe friend that loveth at all times,\nwho is touched with feelings of my infirmities,\nand can do exceeding abundantly for me;\nnever confine my religion to extraordinary occasions,\nbut acknowledge thee in all my ways;\nnever limit my devotions to particular seasons\nbut be in thy fear all the day long;\nnever be godly only on the sabbath or in thy house,\nbut on every day abroad and at home;\nnever make piety a dress but a habit,\nnot only a habit but a nature,\nnot only a nature but a life.\nDo good to me by all thy dispensations,\nby all means of grace,\nby worship, prayers, praises,\nAnd at last let me enter that world where is no temple,\nbut only thy glory and the Lamb's."
