  "content": "Give me to love thee, to embrace thee,\nthough I once took lust and sin in my arms.\nThou didst love me before I loved thee,\nan enemy, a sinner, a loathsome worm.\nThou didst own me when I disclaimed myself;\nThou dost love me as a son,\nand weep over me as over Jerusalem.\nLove brought thee from heaven to earth, from earth to the cross,\nfrom the cross to the grave.\nLove caused thee to be weary, hungry, tempted,\nscorned, scourged, buffeted, spat upon, crucified, and pierced.\nLove led thee to bow thy head in death.\nMy salvation is the point where perfect created love\nand the most perfect uncreated love meet together;\nFor thou dost welcome me, not like Joseph and his brothers,\nloving and sorrowing, but loving and rejoicing.\nThy love is not intermittent, cold, changeable;\nit does not cease or abate for all my enmity.\nHoliness is a spark from thy love\nkindled to a flame in my heart by thy Spirit,\nand so it ever turns to the place from which it comes.\nLet me see thy love everywhere, not only in the cross,\nbut in the fellowship of believers and in the world around me.\nWhen I feel the warmth of the sun may I praise thee\nwho art the Sun of righteousness with healing power.\nWhen I feel the tender rain\nmay I think of the gospel showers that water my soul.\nWhen I walk by the river side\nmay I praise thee for that stream that makes the eternal city glad,\nand washes white my robes that I may have the right to the tree\nof life.\nThy infinite love is a mystery of mysteries,\nand my eternal rest lies in the eternal enjoyment of it."
