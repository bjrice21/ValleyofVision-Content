  "content": "Thou hast placed me in the church\nwhich thy Son purchased by his own blood.\nAdd grace to grace that I may live worthy of my vocation.\nI am a voyager across life's ocean;\nSafe in heaven's ark, may I pass through a troubled world\ninto the harbour of eternal rest.\nI am a tree of the vineyard thou hast planted.\nGrant me not to be barren, with worthless leaves and wild grapes;\nPrune me of useless branches;\nWater me with dews of blessing.\nI am part of the Lamb's bride, the church.\nHelp me to be true, faithful, chaste, loving, pure, devoted;\nLet no strong affection wantonly dally with the world.\nMay I live high above a love of things temporal,\nsanctified, cleansed, unblemished, hallowed by grace,\nthy love my fullness,\nthy glory my joy,\nthy precepts my pathway,\nthy cross my resting place.\nMy heart is not always a flame of adoring love,\nBut, resting in thy Son's redemption,\nI look forward to the days of heaven,\nwhere no langour shall oppress,\nno iniquities chill,\nno mists of unbelief dim the eye,\nno zeal ever tires.\nFather, these thoughts are the stay, prop, and comfort of my soul."
