  "content": "No day of my life has passed\nthat has not proved me guilty in thy sight\nPrayers have been uttered from a prayerless heart;\nPraise has been often praiseless sound;\nMy best services are filthy rags.\nBlessed Jesus, let me find a covert in thy appeasing wounds.\nThough my sins rise to heaven thy merits soar above them;\nThough unrighteousness weighs me down to hell,\nthy righteousness exalts me to thy throne.\nAll things in me call for my rejection,\nAll things in thee plead my acceptance.\nI appeal from the throne of perfect justice\nto thy throne of boundless grace,\nGrant me to hear thy voice assuring me:\nthat by thy stripes I am healed,\nthat thou wast bruised for my iniquities,\nthat thou hast been made sin for me\nthat I might be righteous in thee,\nthat my grievous sins, my manifold sins,\nare all forgiven,\nburied in the ocean of thy concealing blood.\nI am guilty, but pardoned,\nlost but saved,\nwandering, but found,\nsinning, but cleansed.\nGive me perpetual broken-heartedness,\nKeep me always clinging to thy cross,\nFlood me every moment with descending grace,\nOpen to me the springs of divine knowledge,\nsparkling like crystal,\nflowing clear and unsullied\nthrough my wilderness of life."
