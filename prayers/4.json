  "content": "O lord god, who inhabitest eternity,\nThe heavens declare thy glory,\nThe earth thy riches,\nThe universe is thy temple;\nThy presence fills immensity,\nYet thou hast of thy pleasure created life, and communicated\nhappiness;\nThou hast made me what I am, and given me what I have;\nIn thee I live and move and have my being;\nThy providence has set the bounds of my habitation,\nand wisely administers all my affairs.\nI thank thee for thy riches to me in Jesus,\nfor the unclouded revelation of him in thy Word,\nwhere I behold his person, character, grace, glory,\nhumiliation, sufferings, death, and resurrection;\nGive mc to feel a need of his continual saviourhood,\nand cry with Job, 'I am vile',\nwith Peter, 'I perish',\nwith the publican, 'Be merciful to me, a sinner'.\nSubdue in me the love of sin,\nLet me know the need of renovation as well as of forgiveness,\nin order to serve and enjoy thee for ever.\nI come to thee in the all-prevailing name of Jesus,\nwith nothing of my own to plead, no works, no worthiness, no promises.\nI am often straying,\noften knowingly opposing thy authority,\noften abusing thy goodness;\nMuch of my guilt arises from my religious privileges,\nmy low estimation of them,\nmy failure to use them to my advantage,\nBut I am not careless of thy favour or regardless of thy glory;\nImpress me deeply with a sense of thine omnipresence,\nthat thou art about my path, my ways, my lying down, my end."
