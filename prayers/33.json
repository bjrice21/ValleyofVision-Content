  "content": "o my forgetful soul,\nAwake from thy wandering dream;\nturn from chasing vanities,\nlook inward, forward, upward,\nview thyself,\nreflect upon thyself,\nwho and what thou art, why here,\nwhat thou must soon be.\nThou art a creature of God,\nformed and furnished by him,\nlodged in a body like a shepherd in his tent;\ndost thou not desire to know God's ways?\nO god,\nThou injured, neglected, provoked benefactor,\nwhen I think upon thy greatness and thy goodness\nI am ashamed at my insensibility,\nI blush to lift up my face,\nfor I have foolishly erred.\nShall I go on neglecting thee,\nwhen every one of thy rational creatures should love thee,\nand take every care to please thee?\nI confess that thou hast not been in all my thoughts,\nthat the knowledge of thyself as the end of my being\nhas been strangely overlooked,\nthat I have never seriously considered my heart-need.\nBut although my mind is perplexed and divided, my nature perverse,\nyet my secret dispositions still desire thee.\nLet me not delay to come to thee;\nBreak the fatal enchantment that binds my evil affections,\nand bring me to a happy mind that rests in thee,\nfor thou hast made me and canst not forget me.\nLet thy Spirit teach me the vital lessons of Christ,\nfor I am slow to learn;\nAnd hear thou my broken cries."
