  "content": "I depend wholly upon thee,\nwean me from all other dependences.\nThou art my all, thou dost overrule all and delight in me.\nThou art the foundation of goodness,\nhow can I distrust thee?\nhow be anxious about what happens to me?\nIn the light of thy preciousness\nthe world and all its enjoyments are infinitely poor:\nI value the favour of men no more than pebbles.\nAmid the blessings I receive from thee\nmay I never lose the heart of a stranger.\nMay I love thee, my benefactor, in all my benefits,\nnot forgetting that my greatest danger\narises from my advantages.\nProduce in me self-despair that will make Jesus precious to me,\ndelightful in all his offices,\npleasureable in all his ways,\nand may I love his commands as well as his promises.\nHelp me to discern between true and false love,\nthe one consisting of supreme love to thee, the other not,\nthe former uniting thy glory and man-s happiness\nthat they may become one common interest,\nthe latter disjointing and separating them both,\nseeking the latter with neglect of the former.\nTeach me that genuine love is different in kind\nfrom that wrought by rational arguments or the motive of\nself-interest,\nthat such love is a pleasing passion affording joy to the mind\nwhere it is.\nGrant me grace to distinguish between the genuine and the false,\nand to rest in thee who art all love."
