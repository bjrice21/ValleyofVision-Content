  "content": "How little repentance there is in the world,\nand how many sins I have to repent of!\nI am troubled for my sin of passion,\nfor the shame and horror of it as an evil;\nI purpose to give way to it no more,\nand come to thee for strength to that end.\nMost men give vent to anger frequently and are overcome by it,\nbringing many excuses and attentuation for it,\nas that it occurs suddenly,\nthat they delight not in it,\nthat they are sorry afterwards,\nthat godly men commit it.\nThey thus seek peace after outbursts of passion\nby entire forgetfulness of it,\nor, by skimming over their wound, they hope for healing\nwithout peace in Christ's blood.\nLord God, I know that my sudden anger arises\nwhen things cross me,\nand I desire to please only myself, not Christ;\nThere is in all wrongs and crosses a double cross--\nthat which crosses me,\nand that which crosses thee;\nIn all good things there is somewhat that pleases me,\nsomewhat that pleases thee;\nMy sin is that my heart is pleased or troubled\nas things please or trouble me,\nwithout my having a regard to Christ;\nThus, I am like Eli,\nthe subject of punishment for not rebuking sin;\nwhereas I should humbly confess my sin\nand fly to the blood of Christ for pardon and peace.\nGive me, then, repentance, true brokenness, lasting contrition,\nfor these things thou wilt not despise in spite of my sin."
