  "content": "O MY SAVIOUR,\nhelp me.\nI am so slow to learn, so prone to forget, so weak to climb;\nI am in the foothills when I should be on the heights;\nI am pained by my graceless heart,\nmy prayerless days,\nmy poverty of love,\nmy sloth in the heavenly race,\nmy sullied conscience,\nmy wasted hours,\nmy unspent opportunities.\nI am blind while light shines around me:\ntake the scales from my eyes,\ngrind to dust the evil heart of unbelief.\nMake it my chiefest joy to study thee,\nmeditate on thee,\ngaze on thee,\nsit like Mary at thy feet,\nlean like John on thy breast,\nappeal like Peter to thy love,\ncount like Paul all things dung.\nGive me increase and progress in grace so that there may be\nmore decision in my character,\nmore vigour in my purposes,\nmore elevation in my life,\nmore fervour in my devotion,\nmore constancy in my zeal.\nAs I have a position in the world,\nkeep me from making the world my position;\nMay I never seek in the creature\nwhat can be found only in the creator;\nLet not faith cease from seeking thee until it vanishes into sight.\nRide forth in me, thou king of kings and lord of lords,\nthat I may live victoriously, and in victory attain my end."
