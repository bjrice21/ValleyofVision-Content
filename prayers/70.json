  "content": "Thou hast imputed my sin to my substitute,\nand hast imputed his righteousness to my soul,\nclothing mc with a bridegroom's robe,\ndecking mc with jewels of holiness.\nBut in my Christian walk I am still in rags;\nmy best prayers are stained with sin;\nmy penitential tears are so much impurity;\nmy confessions of wrong are so many aggravations of sin;\nmy receiving the Spirit is tinctured with selfishness.\nI need to repent of my repentance;\nI need my tears to be washed;\nI have no robe to bring to cover my sins,\nno loom to weave my own righteousness;\nI am always standing clothed in filthy garments,\nand by grace am always receiving change of raiment,\nfor thou dost always justify the ungodly;\nI am always going into the far country,\nand always returning home as a prodigal,\nalways saying, Father, forgive me,\nand thou art always bringing forth the best robe.\nEvery morning let me wear it,\nevery evening return in it,\ngo out to the day's work in it,\nbe married in it,\nbe wound in death in it,\nstand before the great white throne in it,\nenter heaven in it shining as the sun.\nGrant me never to lose sight of\nthe exceeding sinfulness of sin,\nthe exceeding righteousness of salvation,\nthe exceeding glory of Christ,\nthe exceeding beauty of holiness,\nthe exceeding wonder of grace."
